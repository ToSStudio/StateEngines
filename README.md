# StateEngines
while getting beyond the delay()-command within Arduino I came across the concept of the **StateEngine** 
as covered in several Tutorials. It allows for a sort of Multi-Tasking while leaving CPU-pwr for other
tasks. A logical next step would be to write everything in OOP.

A LED&Key-Shield was lying around and there was intel online about its useage. I ended up using the LEDs
as the eight engines which have completely independent states (on- and off-Times).

![LED, 7Segment and Keys-Module](https://github.com/ToSStudio/StateEngines/raw/master/TM1638_StateEng.jpg)

serves as an example.
